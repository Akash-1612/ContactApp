I've create a React Web Application where the user can save contact information, and subsequently edit and delete those contacts.

Clone the repository in your machine and run following commands in your terminal

//In the backend:- 
node server.js

//In the frontend:- 
npm start

Tech Stack Used
Front End: ReactJS
Backend: NodeJS
Database: MongoDB

Some snapshots of the site.

That's it.
Hope you like it.
